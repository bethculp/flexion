AI Knowledge Center Assignment

Approach: Assess data.gov site and annotate design patterns that seem effective for the assignment, an Artificial Reality Knowledge Center platform. Create simple sitemap and 2 wireframes to illustrate ideas.

The first four pages of the PDF detail the annotations. I found that resources.data.gov had a lot of design patterns and subject matter that I found would align well with the AI site, as the goal was to not only have open source data but to feature examples of the data being used in an effective way, and for the user to be aware of guidelines and tools that they could leverage before trying to create their own solutions.

In an ideal world, I would be able to have interviews and ongoing conversations with the stakeholders and potential users of the site to pin down the problem the site is trying to solve. Going just from the prompt, I came up with the primary goal of this new website as I saw it:

Goal: Present a holistic view of the lifecycle of the open source data - reasons to use it, lessons learned from previous uses, what questions to be asking and what goals one has, what others have done and what has been successful, as well as the ability to dig into the actual data.

From this goal, I created a simple site architecture, which would highlight the three main areas I saw as the priorities:
- Resources the user could leverage and use to gain insights
- Examples the user could learn from to see real life use cases and implementation
- The data itself, which the user could search and implement into their own projects

After annotating a few select screens from the data.gov site, I identified design patterns that I could adopt for this new design. 

In the interest of time, I only created two main wireframes, the homepage and the search results screen.

The homepage showcases some of the design patterns I suspect would be most effective for this site. The search page shows how I envision a more holistic search than what is currently available on data.gov, which currently only lets you search datasets.

From here, I would bring the wireframes and sitemap back to the stakeholders for discussion, including the developers to determine the scope and effort of such an approach to the search. I would want to put the wireframes in front of potential users as soon as possible, to make sure the priority of information is presented in an ideal way for their use cases.

Ideas for further exploration:

- Data cross-connections: As shown in the 4th page of the PDF, I think adding cross-connections between the different content types of the site would be beneficial to the goal of increasing the holistic understanding of the data lifecycle. I would want to create content models of the different types of content and how they are connected.

- Taxonomy: It would be highly beneficial to do more research on the best taxonomy options for this type of data, including if there would be sub-topics of data within AI that would need to be referenced, and which categories and keywords would be most relevant. I included "other ___" for each type of sub category on the site map to indicate there would need to be more research and consultation with experts.

- Community/data submission: I did not get into the details of how one would get their data or project listed on the site. I included Contact in the top utility nav, which would serve as a placeholder for back and forth communication about that. I would want to create a user flow and prototype for that interaction to test.

- Challenges: For a lack of time, I omitted challenges from the sitemap and wireframes as I would want to first solidify the flow between resources, projects, and the data itself. But I understand that relevant challenges would be important to feature on the site and would want to do more research about where they would fit in and how they are interacted with on data.gov.

- Blog posts: I would want to explore the potential use cases of blog posts and updates from the owners of the site. I think there could be many potential uses for this feature but would need to check on the capacity of staff and research how often and what kind of updates they would feel belong in that area.



Alternative approaches:
- I considered combining the resources and data section as one area, but ultimately concluded that the resources were different enough from the actual datasets to warrant their own section.
- I considered doing a card sorting exercise of the different pages on data.gov to give myself a better understanding of the content available and what would be most beneficial. But in the interest of time after looking through the various pages, decided that the main data.gov site and the resources.data.gov site were probably the closest to what I was creating, and focused on the design patterns used there instead.
- Research similar knowledge centers - I would have loved to spend more time looking at other examples of open source data sharing sites, but due to lack of time and the assignment suggestion to just focus on data.gov, stuck to that.
